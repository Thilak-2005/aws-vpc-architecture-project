## üèóÔ∏è Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ VPC with Public and Private Subnets
![](vpc1.png)  
The VPC is divided into **public and private subnets** across multiple availability zones to ensure redundancy and isolation of resources.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Load Balancer
![](images/alb.png)  
The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers in different availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling Group
![](images/auto-scaling.png)  
The **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic load, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ NAT Gateways
![](images/nat-gateway.png)  
The **NAT Gateway** allows instances in private subnets to securely access the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Groups
![](images/security-groups.png)  
**Security Groups** act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level to ensure security.

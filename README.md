## Overview
- **VPC** with public and private subnets  
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution  
- **Auto Scaling Group** for scalability  
- **NAT Gateways** for secure outbound traffic   
- **Security Groups** to control inbound/outbound rules

## üèóÔ∏è Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ VPC with Public and Private Subnets
![](vpc1.png)  
The VPC is divided into **public and private subnets** across multiple availability zones to ensure redundancy and isolation of resources.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Load Balancer
![](load.png)  
The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers in different availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling Group
![](autoscale.png)  
The **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic load, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.

---
### Target Group
A **Target Group** is used by the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to route traffic to registered targets (like EC2 instances, IPs, or Lambda functions).  
It provides:  
- **Load balancing** ‚Äì distributes traffic evenly across healthy instances.  
- **Health checks** ‚Äì continuously monitors the health of targets to route requests only to healthy ones.  
- **Target types** ‚Äì supports EC2 instances, IP addresses, or AWS Lambda.

### Launch Template
A **Launch Template** defines the configuration for EC2 instances.  
It includes:  
- **AMI ID** ‚Äì the operating system and software stack to use.  
- **Instance type** ‚Äì defines the CPU, memory, and networking capacity.  
- **Key pair** ‚Äì for SSH access.  
- **Security groups** ‚Äì to control inbound and outbound traffic.  
- **User data** ‚Äì for automated bootstrapping (like installing software on startup).  

Launch templates help ensure consistent configurations across instances and simplify scaling with Auto Scaling Groups.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ NAT Gateways
![](images/nat-gateway.png)  
The **NAT Gateway** allows instances in private subnets to securely access the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Groups
![](images/security-groups.png)  
**Security Groups** act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level to ensure security.
